# Type30
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: Hello world! My name is Ben and my CS50 Final Project is titled 'Type30'.
#### Type30 is a responsive web application game that essentially tests users on how fast they are able to type 30 random generated word called using an API! I chose this as my final project as I have always loved typing on my keyboard as the sounds produced from my mechanical keyboard after every quick keystroke are soothing to my ears. This project was heavily inspired by more sophisticated websites such as '10FastFingers' and 'TypeRacer'. The application was built utilizing HTML/CSS and Javascript to handle the front-end whilst Python(Flask) and SQLite for the back-end. 

#### Upon a users visit to the website, they will be directed to the homepage. The user can then use the navbar to direct themselves to the game by clicking 'Play'. The game consists of a container which consists of a word display box which will generate 30 random words from an API call each time the page is visited. Under the word display box consists of an input field to where the user can begin typing letters. On the right side of the input field is a timer and a reset button. The reset button will refresh the page on click. The timer starts at 0 seconds and will begin counting up only after the user decides to type something in the input field. As the user types correct letters corresponding to the letter's of each word, the letter will then light up. After successfully typing a word, the word will then be deleted from the word display box to shift the next word to the deleted word's original position. This will continue happening until the user finishes typing all 30 words and will only then, the timer will stop counting up. 

#### From the navbar, there is also a 'boards' href which will direct the user to a leaderboard showing the rankings and user of who participated in the game. The leaderboard is sorted based on who had the fastest time. If the user has played the game and has not registered or logged into their account, the score will not be recorded. On the top right of the navbar is where the user can register and log in for their accounts. The 'boards' href, however, can be viewed by everyone no matter if they are logged in or not.
